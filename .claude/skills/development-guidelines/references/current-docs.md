# Current External Documentation

Apply this reference when a change depends on framework, platform, service, or tool behavior that may have changed since the local skill was written. Official docs are part of the implementation context for these surfaces.

## When to Refresh Docs

Use current official docs before changing behavior governed by fast-moving frameworks, services, or tools that the project depends on.

| Surface | Refresh docs before changing |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| Next.js | Routing/rendering conventions, request/response handling, metadata, caching, configuration, instrumentation, asset/image behavior |
| Sentry | SDK setup, instrumentation, source maps, event capture, PII behavior, runtime-specific config |
| Vercel | Deployment/runtime behavior, asset optimization, storage, environment variables |
| Playwright | Test runner configuration, snapshot behavior, locator/assertion APIs |
| Biome | Formatter/linter configuration, suppression syntax, rule names |
| Zod | Schema/validation APIs (major-version behavior differences) |

**Guidelines:**

- MUST consult current official docs before changing any surface listed in the table.
- MUST use official docs as the primary source; use blog posts, examples, or issues only as secondary context.
- MUST mention the docs consulted in the final summary when the implementation depends on a current-docs decision.
- MUST NOT rely only on memory for APIs, defaults, or behavior that the relevant vendor may have changed.
- SHOULD limit the docs lookup to the smallest surface needed for the task.

## Project-Specific Current-Docs Triggers

Some project areas are especially sensitive because a small API mismatch can produce production-only failures. In this project those are `next.config.ts`, `instrumentation.ts` / `instrumentation-client.ts` (Sentry init), `playwright.config.ts`, and `biome.json`.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST refresh Next.js docs before changing framework entry points, routing/rendering APIs, metadata generation, caching APIs, or framework configuration files.
- MUST refresh Sentry docs before changing its initialization/instrumentation files, event-capture behavior, source maps, or PII settings.
- MUST refresh Vercel docs before changing deployment/runtime assumptions, storage usage, or environment-variable exposure.
- SHOULD refresh Playwright or Biome docs before changing their configuration files, snapshot behavior, or suppression syntax.
