# AGENTS.md Skill Template

A reusable, **framework-agnostic** and **AI-agent-agnostic** starting point for
giving coding agents a structured working agreement and a library of skills.

It is extracted from a production setup and stripped of stack-specific detail,
leaving a generic core you adapt to any project — web, mobile, CLI, library, or
service — and any agent — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and others.

## What's inside

```

The skill core covers cross-project workflow: how to author skills, frame
product requirements, develop and review changes, test (unit + e2e), operate
GitHub, and review for maintainability, security, performance/reliability,
observability, and QA evidence. Project-specific skills
(structure, components, routing, UI, domain) are intentionally **not** shipped —
you add them during adaptation.

An optional **independent-review capability** ships alongside the core:
`REVIEW.md` (the posted-review policy), the `.claude/commands/` entry points,
and the example `.github/workflows/`. Keep and adapt it, or delete it — INIT
Step 4 covers both paths.

## How it works

- **`AGENTS.md`** is the agent-agnostic source of truth: a skill index plus a
  working agreement (plan → implement → self-review → verify → report).
- **`.claude/skills/**`** hold the detailed, progressively-disclosed rules each
  index entry routes to.
- **Bindings** connect a specific agent to `AGENTS.md`: `CLAUDE.md` plus
  `.claude/` for Claude Code; an equivalent rules file for other agents.

## Getting started

1. Copy this template into a new (or existing) repository.
2. Open **[INIT.md](./INIT.md)** and follow it — or hand the repo to an AI agent
   and ask it to "run INIT". INIT reconciles any files a scaffold already
   generated (e.g. an existing `AGENTS.md`), interviews you about the project
   kind, frameworks, architecture (directory structure, business-logic
   structure, state management, styling, theming), and goal, then fills the
   `{{TOKENS}}` via `./init.sh`. For
   each optional capability — unit tests, e2e, observability — it asks whether to
   **add** it (and with which tool) or skip it, rather than assuming it should be
   deleted, and it adds project-specific skills.
3. When adaptation is complete, delete `INIT.md` and this `README.md` (or rewrite
   the README for your project).

Placeholders use the `{{TOKEN}}` convention so they are easy to find and replace;
the full token list lives in [INIT.md](./INIT.md).
